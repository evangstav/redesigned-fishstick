How to Train – Key Takeaways

Derived from the How to Train Guide by Rhonda Patrick, PhD, and expert interviews. fileciteturn0file0

⸻

Why Train?
 • Muscle mass & mortality: More skeletal muscle correlates with lower all-cause mortality and better cognitive health.
 • VO₂ max: Among the strongest predictors of lifespan; “elite” performers enjoy up to 80 % lower mortality risk.

Resistance Training

Core Principles

 1. Consistency – adherence beats perfection.
 2. Progressive overload – gradually raise load/volume.
 3. Recovery – quality sleep, nutrition, de-loading.
 4. Mindset & execution – focus on form, manage stress.

Exercise Categories

Pushing Pulling Legs Accessory
Bench press, OHP Rows, pull-downs Squats, deadlifts Curls, lateral raises

Strength Protocol
 • Load: ≥ 85 % 1 RM
 • Reps: 1–5
 • Sets: 2–3 / exercise (5–10 + weekly)
 • Rest: 2–5 min
 • Frequency: 1–2× per muscle (more volume ⇒ more gains)

Hypertrophy Protocol
 • Load: 60–80 % 1 RM
 • Reps: 6–12
 • Sets: 3–6 / exercise (10–20 + weekly)
 • Rest: 1–2 min
 • Frequency: 2–3× per muscle

Body Recomposition
 • 3+ hypertrophy-focused sessions / week.
 • 1.6–2.2 g protein / kg lean mass.
 • 10–20 % caloric deficit for fat loss.
 • 7–9 h sleep to preserve lean mass.

Time-Efficient Training
 • Equal weekly volume in one long vs. many micro-sessions works.
 • Use supersets, drop sets, ≤ 2 min rests.

Failure, Warm-ups & Stretching
 • Stop ~3–4 reps shy of failure for strength; reserve failure for isolation moves.
 • Dynamic warm-ups aid heavy lifts; static stretching before lifting reduces force. Resistance training itself improves ROM.

Aerobic Training

General Principles
 • 80 % low/moderate : 20 % high-intensity balance.
 • Vary modalities; prioritize enjoyment for adherence.

Intensity Zones (HR ≈ percent HRmax / RPE)

Zone HRmax % RPE Talk Test
1 Recovery 50–60 6–8 Easy chat
2 Low-Mod 60–70 9–12 Sentences
3 Threshold 70–80 13–15 Hard to speak
4 HIIT 80–95 16–18 1–2 words
5 VO₂ max 95+ 19–20 No speech

HIIT Workouts

Protocol Structure Benefit
Norwegian 4×4 4 min @ 85–95 % HRmax × 4, 3 min recovery +7 % VO₂ max
Tabata 20 s all-out / 10 s rest × 8 (1 set) 5–18 % VO₂ max; metabolic upgrades
10-min 10 × 60 s @ 90 % HRmax, 60 s easy Large VO₂ max, insulin sensitivity

Endurance / Zone 2
 • 40–70 % HRmax, 20–90 min, 3–5× / wk (150–300 min total).

“Prescription for Life” (Cardiac Aging Reversal)

1 × Norwegian 4×4, 1 h+ endurance, low-intensity recovery next day, 2 resistance sessions. Total ≈ 5–6 h/wk.

Incidental Fitness
 • VILPA: 4–16 min/day of vigorous lifestyle bursts → 26–55 % lower mortality.
 • Exercise snacks: 3× 20 s stair sprints or bike sprints daily → ↑ VO₂ max, better glucose.

⸻

Advanced Techniques

Blood-Flow Restriction (BFR)
 • 20–50 % 1 RM; 30-15-15-15 reps; continuous cuff 40–50 % arms / 60–80 % legs; 2–3× / wk.

Sauna (Post-Workout)
 • 80–90 °C, 15–30 min, 1–3× / wk (4–7× max) ⇒ ↑ VO₂ max, growth-signaling, recovery.

⸻

Nutrition & Supplements

Protein Targets

Population g / kg BW / day
Sedentary 0.8–1.2
Active / Older 1.2–1.6
Athletes 1.6–2.2
Dieting / Bodybuilding ≥ 2.2

 • Distribute ≥ 20–30 g per meal; protein-rich breakfast curbs cravings.
 • “Anabolic window” is wide; daily total is king.

Creatine Monohydrate
 • Dose: 3–5 g daily (loading 20 g × 5–7 days optional).
 • Combine with carbs/protein for uptake.
 • Benefits: ↑ strength, lean mass, cognition; safe long-term.

Omega-3 (EPA/DHA)
 • Load: 5 g/day (3 g EPA + 2 g DHA) × 4 weeks.
 • Maintain: ~2 g/day.
 • Protects against muscle loss; augments strength gains.

Action Plan Checklist

 1. Resistance: ≥ 10 sets/muscle/week across 2–3 sessions.
 2. Aerobic: 150 min moderate + 1 HIIT session weekly.
 3. Incidental: Add daily stair sprints or brisk hill walks.
 4. Protein: 1.6–2.2 g/kg; ≥ 30 g at breakfast.
 5. Creatine: 5 g post-workout with carbs.
 6. Omega-3: 2 g/day (load if starting).
 7. Sauna: 20 min, 80 °C, 2× / wk.
 8. Sleep: 7–9 h nightly.
